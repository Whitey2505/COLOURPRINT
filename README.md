# COLOURPRINT
THIS USES THE VT102 TERMINAL ESCAPE CODES IN MBASIC TO PRINT TO THE SCREEN IN COLOUR FROM THE SC108/RD2014 STYLE Z80 COMPUTER Z80

NOT ALL TERMINAL PROGRAMS SUPPORT THIS.
i AM USING LINUX MINT ON AN ANCIENT MACBOOK (2012 ERA!)
I USES GTKTERM UNDER LINUX WHICH WORKS PEREFCTLY FOR ME AND SUPPORTS BOTH THE ESCAPE CODES FOR CURSOR POSITIONING AND FOR THE COLOUR FOREGROUND AND BACKGROUND ATTRIBUTES
